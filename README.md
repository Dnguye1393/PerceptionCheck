### About  ###

This project is to allow People who want to play Table top Role playing games to find each other. I have provided multiple ways for GM's and players to find each other and talk. I have made a Games page. This is to allow Gm's to post their games and allow players to request to join. When the players request to join, It is up to the GM to add them. They can check the player's profile, which every user can edit their own, accept the request, or ignore the request. Any person can Edit the wikia for the game, as world building should be done by all players. Possible additional functionality is to restrict the wiki to only people with permission.

The user, from the main page, can also access the forum. Which has topics from them to choose from. Overall it is for discussion or for players or Gm to throw out ideas.

The Inbox and message system is a more private form of the forum. It is to allow the GM and Players to message each other, privately. This is for Players/Gm's to bring up concerns, as personal questions , or discuss the campaign.
